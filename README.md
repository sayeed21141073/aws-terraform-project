**Task:** Use Terraform to create a simple AWS infrastructure that includes:
1. A VPC with two subnets (one public, one private)
2. An EC2 instance in the public subnet
3. An RDS instance in the private subnet
4. A security group to allow SSH access to the EC2 instance and appropriate access to the RDS instance.

**Solution:** Provided the Terraform code. This code can be run by terraform init -> terraform plan -> terraform apply.
